🧠✨ PolyGenix
AI-Powered Idea Engine for 3D Printable Designs
🚀 What Is This?

PolyGenix is what happens when:

Tkinter

OpenAI

Image generation

And 3D printing dreams

…all decide to collaborate.

You type an idea.
AI expands it.
Then it generates images for those ideas.

Boom. Instant creative pipeline.

🛠 What It Actually Does
1️⃣ Idea Generation

You enter something like:

futuristic desk organizer


PolyGenix asks AI to generate:

5 ideas (Short mode)

15 ideas (Extended mode — aka “creative overdrive”)

2️⃣ Image Creation

Each idea becomes:

A 1024x1024 AI-generated image

Saved locally in /outputs

Displayed inside the app

It’s basically:

Brainstorming + Concept Art + File Output
in one click.

🎮 How To Use

Enter your design theme.

Choose:

Short [5 variants] → Focused creativity

Extended [15 variants] → Absolute idea explosion

Click Create

Cycle through generated images.

🧠 Behind The Scenes Magic

Uses gpt-3.5-turbo for idea generation

Uses image generation model for visuals

Saves images locally using base64 decoding

Preview system resizes images cleanly

Dark theme because we are professionals

📂 Output System

All generated images are stored in:

/outputs/request1.jpg
/outputs/request2.jpg
...


Which means:

You can reuse them

Edit them

Turn them into actual STL models

Or just admire them like modern art

⚠️ Things That Make This Cool

Local image saving

Model-based idea expansion

Multiple generation modes

Preview cycling logic

Clean themed UI

This is not just a school project.

This is:

🧠 Prototype SaaS Energy™

🔐 Setup Requirements

Python 3.x

ttkthemes

Pillow

requests

openai

Your own API key (don’t leak it 👀)

Install dependencies:

pip install ttkthemes pillow requests openai

📈 What This Could Become

You are one step away from:

Exporting ideas to text files

Adding a “Regenerate” button

Adding a style selector (minimalist, cyberpunk, organic)

Adding STL generation via AI

Turning this into a web app

Slapping a landing page on it

Calling it a startup

PolyGenix.io anyone? 😄

🧾 Final Thoughts

This project says:

“I don’t just code games.
I build creative tools.”
